# BlogApplication

**Problem Statement**: "Using any language or framework, we ask that you design and build an article or blog post on which others can submit comments. Your code should touch on both the front end and the back end."

This is a simple blog created using the Django full-stack framework primarily in Python. Bootstrap was used for the visual design of the code.
